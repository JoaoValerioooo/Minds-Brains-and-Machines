# Minds-Brains-and-Machines

How should intelligence be modelled? There seems to be a general agreement within the Cognitive Sciences (Psychology, Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence) that intelligence is mostly computation. Despite this agreement, these disciplines differ on the adequate level of explanation in which computation should be characterized. Computational Neuroscience, for example, attempts to understand how brains "compute" but it emphasizes descriptions of biologically realistic neurons and their physiology. But, is this an adequate level of explanation?
The aims of the course are to discus these issues and to briefly introduce AI students in the fields of computational neuroscience, neuroscience and psychology to see how these disciplines can enrich each other.
